            <p>I'm a frontend developer with a background in graphic design and UX design. I work mostly with HTML5, CSS (SASS) and Javascript. I also have basic knowledge of PHP and Python.</p>

            <p>I'm currently working full-time at <a href="https://www.queo.pt/">Queo</a>, so I'm not available to work on other projects. But you can still say <a href ="{{ url_for('contact') }}">hello</a>.</p>

            <p>You can also see <a href="" class="projects-link">some work I've done before</a>, either in just Design or Design and Development.</p>
