Pickipicki is a white-labeled peer-to-peer marketplace that uses an Interface that wants to simplify the way people buy and sell online. This is still a work in progress and I'm taking care of design and frontend development. The frontend uses [Bootstrap Sass](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass).
