A Thousand Faces is a website where you can have your portrait published, drawn by [Jos√© Cardoso](http://zecardoso.com/) (project author). I designed the website and developed both the backend and frontend. It contains an adapted CMS, a simple webstore, a forum and user pages. Built with [Drupal](http://drupal.org/).
