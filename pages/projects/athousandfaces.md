A Thousand Faces is a website where you can have your portrait published, drawn by [Jos√© Cardoso](http://zecardoso.com/). I designed the website and developed both the backend and frontend. It contains an adapted CMS, a simple webstore, a forum and user pages. All built with [Drupal](http://drupal.org/).
